        <h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
        <p>
          By James Clear World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered
          a simpler system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting
          change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions -
          doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a
          single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
